# Collection of Night Owl Themes

This is a bunch of ports made by me for different tools based on the popular [Night Owl theme by Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).

## Installation:

In each folder there is a quick guide to install the theme for the selected tool.

## Note:

I hope this is helpful for someone who wants to style everything around this theme, just like me. ðŸ™‚
